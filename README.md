PlayFab pentesting proxy

A proxy I made a few months back to pentest PlayFab API request interception.

No support is provided and if you bother me on how to use this I will respectfully ask you to leave my sight immediately.

# Addendum
This code is *fucking cursed* - and not because of the code quality this time. I can't get it to work anymore and testers on Windows with their own Cloudflare tunnels couldn't get it working either, and when it did run it was causing some weird effects.

I was able to get this code to work fine a few months ago and I don't know what happened in that time.

Seriously, I don't know what kind of insanity this code (or Cloudflare?) is incurring, but I wish you luck if you attempt to run this at all.
